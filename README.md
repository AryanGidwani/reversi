# reversi
The attached file contains a fully programmed version of the popular game Reversi. It's a game that takes place between the user and the computer. The computer uses an algorithm that I programmed, to find the best available move in the given position. The game ends when the entire board is filled up, and a winner is based on who has more tiles on the board.
